Pull in changes from the main branch.

Use `git pull origin main` to bring in changes from the main
branch. DO NOT use `--rebase`. I want this to be a merge commit
so I can see it in the git history and revert if needed.

Address any merge conflicts that might arise. If you're unsure
of how to resolve them, stop and ask me.
