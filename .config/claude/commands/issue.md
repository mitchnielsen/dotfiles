Create an issue in Linear using the Linear MCP server.

Use the following context in the issue: #$ARGUMENTS

If I don't specify which team to use for the issue, use "Platform" team under
the "Engineering" team.

If I don't specify a status, use Backlog.

Make a best effort guess to choose labels. If the team used is "Platform",
make sure to apply a label for each of the "type" and "repo" label groups.

If I don't specify a priority, make a best effort guess. If you're unsure,
"Medium" is a safe guess.

If I don't specify a cycle, do not apply one.

When finished, tell me the title of the issue and provide a link for me to click
to open the issue in Linear.
