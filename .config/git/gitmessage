# https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

# The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

#     fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
#     feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
#     BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
#     types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
#     footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

#  A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.
